Dainty. A word to describe delicate, small and pretty things in the world.

A word my skin seems to directly juxtapose despite the longing to have its label.

Being a woman encompasses this word through and through and yet it is everything I am not.

There is nothing more infuriating than longing to be dainty when everything about your body screams no.
