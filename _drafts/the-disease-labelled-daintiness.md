Dainty. A word to describe delicate, small and pretty things in the world.

A word my skin seems to directly juxtapose despite the longing to have its label.

Being a woman encompasses this word through and through and yet it is everything I am not.

? There is nothing more infuriating than wanting to be dainty when everything about your body screams no.

? I wish that one day the sadness for longing to have this label may cease, like my inability to be the delicate, small pretty woman society wants me to be.
