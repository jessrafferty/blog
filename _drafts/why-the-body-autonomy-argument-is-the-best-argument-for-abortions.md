title: Why the Body Autonomy argument is the best argument for abortions

The body autonomy argument is the basic understanding that people have a right to control what happens to their body without being influenced or coerced into certain actions.

The general basis of the pro-choice argument for the right for people to have abortions is that they have the right to control what happens to their body and as the foetus inside of them is part of their body they have the right to choose what happens to it- either to birth it or abort it. Often, this argument stops here. People understand that you cannot willingly force or influence someone into doing something they don't want to do with their body.

However, i believe this argument would hold a more substantial weight if it provided simple and effective examples to demonstrate how in the real world we don't force people against their will, and why we shouldn't force people's choices on receiving an abortion or not.

1.  You wouldn't force anyone to get a piercing or a tattoo.

2. Patient's can refuse treatments

e.g. cancer, R v Blaue- Jehovah's Witness

3. We even respect the wishes of dead people

e.g. DNR and refusal of donating organs
